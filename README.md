# stackin

{ONE_LINE_LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION} for fiscal document issuance — a handful of business fields, nothing about certificates, XML, XSD, signing or SOAP. The API resolves all of that from the issuer's own configuration, identified by `api_key`.

**One {CLASS_OR_STRUCT}, `Invoice`** — `{issue}()`/`{consult}()`/`{cancel}()`, nothing else to instantiate. Each line item is a `{Product}` — `description`/`amount` (or your language's casing) apply to any document type; `ncm`/`cfop` (plus everything else on `Product`: `cest`, tax groups, presumed credits...) are Brazil-specific and required per item for NFE, ignored for NFSE.

## Install

```{shell}
{install command}
```

## Usage

Get an `api_key` from the [stackin dashboard](https://app.stackin.io) — select the issuing company, then Settings → API key (context `sdk`). One key per issuing company, shown once at creation. The API resolves the issuer (CNPJ, state, address, certificate, environment) entirely from it; nothing about the issuer is ever passed on a call. Defaults to `https://sdk.stackin.io`.

```{lang}
{end-to-end usage example, mirroring the other language's example 1:1 — same field names in this language's casing, same NFE/NFSE split, same recipient state note}
```

`recipient_address`/`RecipientAddress` is an `Address`, but despite the name only `.state`/`.State` is read — the rest of the fields aren't sent anywhere yet. It's the actual customer's state, used only to set `idDest` (interstate vs internal) on NFE — optional, omitting it always produces `idDest=1` (internal).

## Errors

- `{APIError}` — the API responded with a non-2xx status ({status/detail fields}) — a 401 here means `api_key` is missing, wrong, or was rotated.
- `{ConnectionFailedError}` — the API didn't respond (network/DNS/timeout).
- `{ValidationError}` — `issue()`'s items is empty, or missing `ncm`/`cfop` on an item for NFE.

Building the full fiscal document (issuer data, service code, tax groups, schema-accurate XML) is the API's job — configured once per company, not passed on every call.

## Examples

Runnable end-to-end {scripts/programs} in [`examples/`](examples/) — `simple_issue_nfe` and `simple_issue_nfse`, each with a catalog of realistic line items covering every optional field.
